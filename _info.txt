start
0. manual start
phases
1. 8 shape path while producing energy (unroll)
2. I shape path while consuming energy (roll)

-GPL
-both experimental and simulation
target compagny:
decathlon, ...

thema:
fluid mechanics, electricity, control.

kite
=> 2 driving ropes
=> 2 controled motors/generators
=> 2 phases:
   way:  traction, production
   back: release,  consumption
=> control: traction and path/phase

fluid mechanics:
- kite
- traction

electricity:
- power: production/consumption ratio

control:
- uC
- position: vision, rotation
